# PyDie

A Python dice box

This script requiers a file called log.txt to exist in the same folder as the script, the file should auto-create if it doesn't exists. You'll need write permissions in the folder to run it though.

Android is shitting a brick over the log file currently, this is almost certainly permissions related.
